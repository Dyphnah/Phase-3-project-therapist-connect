## Project Instructions

Welcome to the end of Phase 3! You've learned about a lot in this unit:

Python fundamentals.
Data structures (and more recently, algorithms).
Object-oriented programming.
Object inheritance.
Class attributes and methods.
Configuring applications.
SQL fundamentals.
Table relations in SQL.
Object-relational mapping with Python.
Object-relational mapping with SQLAlchemy.
Building CLIs.

In this project, we're going to use these skills to create a CLI. We want you to display knowledge of as much from Phase 3 as you can- you won't be able to fit everything in, but we'll expect to see:

## Deliverables

1. A CLI application that solves a real-world problem and adheres to best practices.
2. A database created and modified with SQLAlchemy ORM with 3+ related tables.
3. A well-maintained virtual environment using Pipenv.
4. Proper package structure in your application.
5. Use of lists, dicts, and tuples.
6. Appropriate and accurate implementation of an algorithm from the Data Structures and Algorithms Canvas module.

## Start of Project/ Problem Statement.

In the field of software engineering, professionals and students often face tremendous pressure and challenges, leading to increased stress levels and potential mental health issues. 

The demanding nature of the industry, coupled with the pursuit of perfectionism, can contribute to burnout, anxiety, and depression among software engineers and engineering students. 

Acknowledging these challenges, it becomes crucial to provide accessible resources and support systems for individuals seeking mental health assistance.

To address this need, Therapist Connect directory was developed.


## Project Name: Therapist Connect

Therapist Connect is a command-line interface (CLI) application designed to help users find mental health professionals, including therapists, counselors, and psychiatrists. It provides access to a directory of these professionals, along with user reviews and ratings, making the decision-making process easier.

With Therapist Connect, the aim is to promote mental well-being within the software engineering community and provide a supportive resource for individuals navigating the complexities of the field.

This project utilizes SQLAlchemy and implements a many-to-many relationship between therapists and specialties.

## Installation

To run Therapist Connect, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Activate your virtual environment and install the required dependencies by running pipenv install
4. Run `main.py` to launch the application.

## Dependencies
1. Python 3.10.12
2. SQLAlchemy

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can perform the following actions:

1. View all therapists
2. Search for a therapist by name, location, specialty, or reviews
3. Review a therapist
4. Exit the application

Upon running the application, follow the on-screen prompts to navigate through the directory and interact with the available functionalities.
